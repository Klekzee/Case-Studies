## Background:

This case study analysis is part of the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone Project**. I will be delving into the role of a junior data analyst for the marketing team of Bellabeat, analyzing existing data about fitness and health habits from another app called FitBit. My goal is to gather insights to implement into the Bellabeat app. I will be following the steps of the data analysis process: **Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act**, in order to answer the business objectives.

### Business Task:

Analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. Then, select one Bellabeat product to apply these insights for Bellabeat marketing strategy.

For this analysis, I have decided to choose Bellabeat App as the product.

### Business Objectives:

1. What are the trends identified?
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

## Data:

The dataset can be found publicly on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit).

## Tools:

**Python** for Data Cleaning, Data Wrangling, Data Analysis, and Data Visualization.
