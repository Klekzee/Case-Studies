# INTRODUCTION

This Exploratory Data Analysis examines the publicly available [Wordle Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/benhamner/wordle-tweets) dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes tweets from various users detailing their performance on the daily Wordle puzzle throughout the year of 2022. It provides valuable insights such as the number of attempts it took for users to solve the puzzle.

In this analysis, I explored several key aspects:

1. Trend Analysis: I examined the trend of the game over the year, identifying any significant changes in participation or performance over time.

2. Average Attempts to Solve: I calculated the average number of attempts it took for players to guess the correct word, providing an insight into the general difficulty level of the game.

3. Hardest Puzzle/Word: I identified the hardest puzzle or word based on the number of attempts players needed to solve it.

4. Letter Analysis: I determined the most common letters appearing in the solutions. This helps in understanding common patterns and strategies that players might use to solve the puzzles more efficiently.
